Health
======
This web application has been developed by Ron Rider (rideron89@gmail.com) as an attempt to create a website from the ground-up, including both design and development.

The layout was designed in Photoshop using the 960.gs grid system using 12 columns.

The database for this project can be configured by loading the DB file (design/database_design.db) into a MySQL database named "health".
